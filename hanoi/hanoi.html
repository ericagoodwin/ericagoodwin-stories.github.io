Hanoi <br>
<br>
Somehow, in the middle of that living, <br>
breathing, beating city, <br>
an inchworm <br>
on my cheekbone. <br>
<br>
I wondered how, <br>
for a moment, <br>
but I knew.<br>
<br>
It was living, breathing, beating— same as I. <br>
<br>
That summer, I watched the city lights float by<br>
on a plane ride back from Austin,<br>
tiny orange lights like fish eggs. <br>
<br>
A whole town anonymous.<br>
Living, breathing, beating, <br>
maybe. <br>
<br>
That was the summer Tristan died,<br>
though it was months before I said it.<br>
<br>
Tonight, the rain drips down like footsteps<br>
in a world no longer his.<br>
<br>
Somewhere, the streetlights are flickering<br>
on, a stoplight is turning yellow,<br>
a houseplant is turning brown.<br>
<br>
I guess to be alive <br>
is just to be alive <br>
and that’s enough.
