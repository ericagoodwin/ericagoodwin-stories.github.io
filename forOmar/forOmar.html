<p> We grew up in each other’s passenger seats. </p> <p>We shared our darkest secrets, our fears, our regrets, <br> while untouched college applications sat open <br> on our laptops. We drove circles <br> around this place, back and forth and back <br> again, and we felt the weight of the world <br> against our spines and time itself <br>snapping at our heels. </p> <p> We loved and didn’t love and lost our virginities <br>and drove home alone, with the silent streetlights and <br> winding freeways. We knew we loved our mothers. <br> We found it within ourselvesto love our fathers, <br> and placed ourselves somewhere in-between. </p> <p> We drank coffee just to feel alive. We found home <br>between the lines of each other’s poetry and even then<br> we were not poet enough to build something real. <br>We drove to lookouts just to get away and got <br> parking tickets. </p> <p> And that was it and then it ended. </p> <p> And that was it and then time moved on and so <br> we did too and we were gone and the town <br>was still there: the lookout and the roads and <b> every moment that ever burned and <br> every bit of ourselves we left behind. </div>
